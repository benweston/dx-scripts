# Assets

> Non-code resources used by the repository.   

## Purpose

The `assets/` directory stores files that support the documentation or presentation of the project, such as:   

- Repository banner images   
- Diagrams or architecture visuals   
- Screenshots   
- Logos or icons   
- Additional supporting media   

These files are referenced by the main `README.md` and other documentation as needed.
